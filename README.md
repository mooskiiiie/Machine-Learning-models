# Machine-Learning-models
This repository is a collection of notebooks that I used to practice different learning algorithms, and to keep track of how to implement them.
Feel free to use them for your own learnings as well!

The repository will consists of different learning algorithms for both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
- Classification
- Clustering
- Regression
